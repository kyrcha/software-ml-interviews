## What is precision?

Used mostly in information retrieval (or binary classification), precision is a metric that defines how precise I am in my retrievals (or predictions). Meaning from the things I say they are class A (i.e. True), how many are they trully A? How precise am I in predicting A? More mathematically it is TP/(TP + FP).

## What is recall?

Again used in informations retrieval, recall is a metric that defines how good my algorithm is in retrieving (or predicting) the correct documents (or classes) out of all the correct documents (or classes). It is the percentage of the documents denoted as A retrieved vs. all the A documents (retrieved or not). More methematically it is TP/(TP+FN)

## What is bayesian optimization?

Bayesian optimization is a technique to optimise function that is expensive to evaluate.

## What does the p-value mean?

TODO.
